## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Recommendation-based sorting or scoring
Recommendation-based sorting/scoring for course selection MUST be removed in favor of transparent deterministic sorts.

#### Scenario: Removing recommended sort
- **WHEN** users sort/filter courses
- **THEN** no "recommended" option or hidden scoring remains; only explicit fields (course code, time, teacher, etc.) are used.
